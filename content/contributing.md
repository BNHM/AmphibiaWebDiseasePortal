In order to contribute data to the Amphibian Disease Portal, you will need to upload your data into <a href="https://geome-db.org/">GEOME</a>.  GEOME will perform data validation and hosts all data that is accessible on the Amphibian Disease Portal.  Following are the steps for loading data.

<ol>
<li>Navigate to <a href="https://geome-db.org/">GEOME</a>
<li>Click on "Workbench" and choose "Amphibian Disease"
<li>Click on "Generate Template" on the left side of the screen.  Choose the fields you want to include in your project and then click on "Export Excel"
<li>Fill out your spreadsheet using the template that you just downloaded.
<li>Once you insert your data into the Excel Sheet, there are two options:
<ul>
   <li>Send your spreadsheet to an administrator to upload.  This is currently the only method that we support
   <li>Uplaod your own spreadsheet into GEOME.  Please email the administrator and request to be added to the "Amphibian Disease" project.  Once you are authorized to load into the Amphibian Disease project on GEOME you can manage your data from there.
</ul>
</ol>
